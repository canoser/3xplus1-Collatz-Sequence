The Collatz conjecture[a] is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. (See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture)
It calculates how many steps it takes for each number between two input numbers (entered via the keyboard) to reach 1 one by one.
If desired, it returns a list of all sequence elements for the number that takes the most steps to reach 1.
